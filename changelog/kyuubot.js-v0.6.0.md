# UPDATE to v0.6.0 - STILL IN BETA

# CHANGELOG
- Added a new survey feature. Some specific keywords can trigger dedicated templates.
  * command: !survey [your question] => raises a question with 3 options (yes/no/other) that ends 10 minutes.
  * keyword: amongus => raises a question with 7 options (one for each weekday) that ends 8 hours later.
